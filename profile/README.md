## Steps for contributing ‚úèÔ∏è

**Before doing anything, ensure you are a member of the IRSS github organization. If you are not, provide Harry with your github associated email and he will add you**


### There are multiple ways to contribute to this org. 
&rarr; If you already have an existing repo, go to A 

&rarr; If you are creating a new repo, go to B

&rarr; If you are sharing a repo with one or several people, go to C

&rarr; If you don't have a repo and don't want to make one, go to D

<br />

### A: You already have an existing repo, start here. 

1) Make sure your repo has a useful README.md file that provides info on how to use the repo.

2)  Go to the repo on your personal Github website and then Settings

3) At the bottom of the page, in the "Danger Zone" section 
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3EuAsjZDUJefK/giphy.gif" width="120" height="80" />


4) Under "Change repository visibility", ensure the repo is public (this wont work with private repos)

5) Click "Transfer" in the "Danger Zone" section

6) Under new owner, tick the option that says "Select one of my organizations" and set IRSS-UBC target. Provide a new name for the repo, or keep the old name. Confirm the transfer.

6) Transfering may take a minute. Once it is done, head over to IRSS-UBC org and locate your repo under "Repositories" at the bottom of the page.

7) You should now [make a fork of this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) so you have a copy on your personal Github. This is done using the "Fork" button on the top of the repo screen. 

8) After forking the repo, you now have a forked version of it on your personal github. 

9) If you want to update your contribution to your IRSS-UBC org repo, you can do so by [creating a pull request from your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). After submitting the pull request on your personal guthub, head to the UBC-IRSS org version of the repo to accept the pull request. Now, the personal and org repos will match.

<br />

***Note that if you want to remove your repo from the IRSS org, this can easily be done by going to settings on the repo and transfering it back to your Github personal account. Before transfering back, you need to delete the forked version of the repo if you have one.***

<br />

For more detailed information about transfering repos see this [site](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository)

<br />

### B: You do not have an existing repo start here

1) On the UBC-IRSS gitub org go to the "Repositories" tab

2) Click "New Repository" 

3) Provide the required input fields, and ensure the repo is public. Tick the Add a README file box. 

4) Follow steps 7 - 10 in section A


<br />


### C: You are sharing a repo with someone working on the same project

1) It is best to keep code that is for the same project (e.g., Silva21) in the same repo. If you are working on a project with someone, ensure your code is in the same repo, and then follow steps in either section A or B depending on context.

<br />


### D: You don't have a repo and don't want to make one

If you have limited git/github experience but stil want to contribute, send me your script(s) and I will add them to the Tutorials repo. However, this option is not as desirable as A and B because it is not as easy to update your files.

### Try and incorporate some [github best practices](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/best-practices-for-projects) in your repos.
